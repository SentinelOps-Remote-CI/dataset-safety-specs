# Shape Safety Verifier Executable

Command-line tool for verifying shape safety of ONNX models.

## Missing Components (Future Implementation):
- Real ONNX parsing using protobuf (currently stubbed)
- End-to-end demo with GPT-2 (124M) model
- Real induction proofs for layer shapes
- Integration with onnx2lean_shape.py converter
